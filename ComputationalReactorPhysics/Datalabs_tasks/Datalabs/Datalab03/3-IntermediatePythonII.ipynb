    "During the previous datalab we learnt about the basic principles of numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and reviewed how to perform pattern searh with regular expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this datalab we progress further and learn about several things. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will review how to write a class in python (our first step towards object oriented programming). Although you will not be required to build classes during this course,  later when we will use the OpenMC Monte Carlo particle transport code, it will be adventageous if you have a basic understanding of classes. Also most python packages provide an API where the understanding of classes is inevitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are several data formats or markup languages to store data, here we will get acquinted with three which is often used in nuclear engineering software and for nuclear data:\n",
    "    - csv: comma separated values\n",
    "    - XML: eXtensible Markup Language\n",
    "    - JSON: JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will learn about an other mainstream standard libary: pandas, which is often used for data analysis. The reason we will need some basic idea about this package is that we will later extract OpenMC results as pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We will learn how to use python as an internet browser!\n",
    "5. Finally we review how to install and use not mainstream python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class is a collection of data and functionality. It allows us to define a new type of object, and after the Class definition we can create new instances of that class. An instance will have **attributes** (variables describing the state of the instance) and **methods**, functions which allow us to modify the state of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with everything else in Python, there is no \"best\" way to define and use classes, here we are presenting only one general solution, and we are omitting the demonstration of several functionality (for example inheritence). We however encourage you to further develop your understanding with reading the official [python site](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to make this more clear with an example. Consider that we are writing a program, in which we often define materials (for example for a reactor physics application). The materials are being described by the nuclide content, and the density (attributes), and it has some methods to modify these attributes. We can define a class with the `class` keyword, which is then followed by statements. A class can have a special method `__init__`, which will be executed when an instance of the class is created, to create an initial state. Our class also has an other special method `__repr__`, which returns the object representation in string format. None of this is mandatory. Besides these we defined three methods to add nuclides, set the density or to convert the density to other units. One could access and update the state of the instance directly with for example `myMaterial.density = 10.0`, but it is often better programming practice to define function to do such updates. Notice that all the methods have a parameter `self`, this is how you refer to the instance itself, and when you call `myMaterial.set_density(10.0)`, then infact `myMaterial` is also an input of the method.

    "That's about what you have to know about classes for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move onto an other topic and review various data formats often used to store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a software producing data we often want to export it in some format. Some legacy nuclear engineering codes would produce lengthy ASCII files, which are easy to read as a human, but as we saw before might be tricky to read with a computer. To overcome this it us better to export our data into standardized formats which are easy to interpret. Of course there are plenty of such formats to pick from, and we do not intend to review all of them. Notably, we are not going to look into the [hierarchical data format (HDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) which became rather popular recently to store large amount of data (and as we will see later openMC also exports all data into hdf5 files). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will however take a look at some \"simpler\" (ie. readable by humans) formats: like JSON, csv, XML, which are often used in nuclear engineering applications. Along this notebook you will find three example files named '03-sample.json','03-sample.xml' and '03-sample.csv'. Although we will look into how to read this files with python, it is also important that you just visually inspect them with a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of these standardized formats is that most of the programming languages provide readily available libraries and functions to parse these formats. So it is simple to transfer data between various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a standard file format which uses human-readable text to store data object consisting of attribute-value pairs and arrays. Remember dictionaries and lists? Dictionaries were attribute (key)-value pairs, and lists were arrays. So although JSON originates from JavaScript, in fact the syntax of the JSON format resembles the syntax of python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to appriciate even more why is it worth learning about JSON: after this lecture you will be well prepared to write your own scripts to visualize various aspects of [Covid-data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json), what maybe others have not thought of yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file '03-sample.json' contains the results of a calculation where a piece of iron was irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons (the file was created with an activation and transmutation code called FISPACT-II, later during the course we will learn more about transmutation calculations). If we review the contant of the file, we see that indeed it very much looks like a dictionary with keys called `run_data` and `inventory_data`, and storing lists and nested dictionaries as values.\n",

What we can however notice is that the Cs-137 content is strongly correlated to the burnup (the longer the fuel is irradiated, the more is created, as we will see in later lectures), and is strongly correlated (even if the value is negative) to the cooling time (the longer the fuel is cooled, the the more Cs-137 has decayed away).

The way how we access data from the internet is most often with a browser: we type in a URL, and based on that our browser sends a request to a server (with the GET method of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol) containing the data we are interested in, then the data is sent back to us, and the browser renders it.

    "It was mentioned a lot of times that you can find several packages, and use them. But how to do that? It is fairly simple. Once you found the package you can install it with the python package installer `pip` (or with `conda`, depending on how you installed python), which you can run from your terminal or command prompt. Some packages are registered to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) the Python package index, these you can simply install with `pip install nameofpackage`. There are some which are not registered at PyPI and deployed at some other site, like github. These you can usually install with `pip install urlofpackage`. Nevertheless, any well maintained package will let you know how to to install it, and you just have to follow that. Also a well maintained package will include a 'setup.py' file, which lists the dependencies of the package (for example that it requires NumPy), from which `pip` will figure out whether any other dependent packages need to be installed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a typical example we can take a look at a package called `radioactivedecay`: https://pypi.org/project/radioactivedecay/. The site clearly describes that you can install it with `pip install radioactivedecay`. Once that is done, you can import the package in your scripts. Also the developer has to provide examples, which with the knowledge you have acquired up to now, you can easily follow. For example the usage of this package is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    >>> import radioactivedecay as rd\n",
    "    >>> inv_t0 = rd.Inventory({'Mo-99': 2.0})\n",
    "    >>> inv_t1 = inv_t0.decay(20.0, 'h')\n",
    "    >>> inv_t1.contents\n",
    "    {'Mo-99': 1.6207863893776937,\n",
    "    'Tc-99': 9.05304236308454e-09,\n",
    "    'Tc-99m': 1.3719829376710406}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you import the library. Then, you create an instance of the `Inventory()` class, which takes a dictionary as parameter containing the activity of isotopes. Then, you call the `.decay()` method while specifying the decay time, and you can `contents` of the inventory after the decay time elapsed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since most of the python packages are open source, you can build on them, or modify them if you find that some functionality is missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the take away message here is, that if you have a problem to solved, do not hesitate to first look for a package which already solves it."
