    "\n",
    "From Experiment 2 we learnt a very important lesson about the simulation of fission chains: simulating supercritical systems is not straightforward, since in such systems the number of neutrons diverges. The terminology refers to this set of problems as \"Monte Carlo Eigenvalue calculation\", which means, Monte Carlo calculations intended to estimate the k-effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is to estimate the k-effective in cycles or batches (which is related to a neutron generation), and finally take an average of the k-effective estimate in each batch (see p37 of https://mcnp.lanl.gov/pdf_files/la-ur-16-29043.pdf). This means that we launch $N$ neutrons in a batch and we follow all of them. When they reach there location of death (either capture or fission) we sample how many neutrons they give birth to. Then from the number of new neutrons and the number of original neutrons we can estimate the k-effective. Then in the next batch we launch again $N$ neutrons. We repeat this until the uncertainty on the average of the k-effective estimates is acceptable. \n",

    "**Note #2**: in our simple model the location of the fission events is not tracked, however in a proper geometry one would also keep track of that: one would save the fission sites in a list called the \"bank\".
