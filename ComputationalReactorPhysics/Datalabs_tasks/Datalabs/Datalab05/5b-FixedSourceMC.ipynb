This is not a very realistic problem, and it is also not a practically relevant one, however it provides an excellent opportunity to us to see how the pieces of neutron transport can be put together. The reason is because the physics is very simple in this case, so our usual approximations are rather good:\n",

That said, it can be estimated by summing all the distances traveled by neutrons in a volume (this is called *track-length estimator*). However, in our case we would like to obtain the space dependence of the flux, thus the knowledge of traveled disctance in slices of the slab would be required. For which one needs to know where a certain particle crosses the surface dividing volumes. This is not a difficult task (one only needs to find the intersection of a line and a plane/surface), and for heterogeneous geometries (ie. which are built of regions filled with different materials) it is anyhow required to keep track of such events.\n",

For us, always $w_i=1$, thus $W$ will be the number of simulated particles. So in fact we will need to add $1/N\\Sigma_t$ at every collision event, and in case we would like to get the spatial dependence of the flux, we can score this into some predefined space bins. The final value flux estimator will give the flux per source particle. If one is interested in the total physical flux, the results should be renormalized with the the source rate."
