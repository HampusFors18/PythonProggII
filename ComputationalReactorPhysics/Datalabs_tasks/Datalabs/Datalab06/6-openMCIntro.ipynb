    "In our previous endeavours we experienced that performing an accurate simulation of particle transport is not trivial. There are several software being developped to solve this task, and for someone who is more interested in performing the analysis of a reactor core, it is often better to use an already verified and validated code instead of developping one from scratch. There are several such codes solving neutron transport either relying on deterministic or stochastic methods. During this datalab we will use a rather young code called openMC, which was originally developped at MIT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC is a Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport simulation code. It can be used both for fixed source and for criticality calculations. The user can define complicated geometries with constructive solid geometries. OpenMC is written in C++, however it has a rich Python API, which will allow us to comminicate with the code through jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC is not yet an industrial standard code, however our motivation to use it for this course was that it is \n",
    "\n",
    "1. freely available\n",
    "2. the important physics we could not tackle within this course ourselves (eg. thermal scattering and several reactions) are implemented in it\n",
    "3. since we can interact with the code through python, we can deepen our programming skills\n",
    "4. for small problems it runs relatively fast on a single PC\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, today we are going to walk through a simple openMC input file. During this course we will only work with pincell models (ie. a single fuel pin infinite in the axial length with reflective boundaries, so neutrons are reflected back from the geometry in this way approximating an infinite core). This is of course a simplification of a complete reactor core, but it will still allow us to see a lot of cool physics. One could of course perform simulations at the assembly level or for a full-core, however such simulations would be more time consuming. There are several further examples at https://docs.openmc.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that this notebook should be opened from an environment where openmc is available!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The input file\n",
    "\n",
    "During the datalab we will define the following problem which roughly matches a typical western-type pressurized water reactor's conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PWR pincell with reflective boundaries\n",
    "- Fuel radius: 0.41 cm\n",
    "- Fuel material: enriched UO2 with density 10.5 g/cm3\n",
    "- Cladding inner/outer radius: 0.42/0.45 cm\n",
    "- Cladding material: zirconium  with density 6.6 g/cm3\n",
    "- Coolant/moderator: pressurized water with density 0.75 g/cm3\n",
    "- Cell pitch: 1.26 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in practice, PWR fuel cladding is made of an alloy called Zircaloy, nevertheless it has little influence on the neutron economy, therefore we will approximate it as pure zirconium with its natural abundence of isotopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we need in order to define an openMC input?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Materials: which materials are included in our geometry (nuclide content, temperature, density)?\n",
    "2. Geometry: how does the geometry look like? \n",
    "3. Tally: what are the quantities of interest? For example flux, or fission rate?\n",
    "4. Settings: how many neutrons we would like to include in the calculation?\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of this steps we will use the python API to export an xml file, which the code will use once we execute it. Note however that one could directly write xml files without using python, and run the code outside of jupyter. For larger problems this is sometimes better. However we will want to analyse the output results in python, and sometimes we will script the input, so for us it is handy to use the python API.\n",

We create an instance of `Material()`, with a numeric id of the material, and then we can add nuclides, and set the density. We can also set the temperature (which can be 294 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, 1500 K, the temperatures at which the cross sections are evaluated). There are other options as well (for example one can directly set an enrichment), what you can find in the documentation.\n",
