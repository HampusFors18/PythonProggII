Also because they are often a bit counterintuitive: we often think about subcriticality in terms of decreasing neutron population, but this is not the case if we we place a steady source in the system.

We will sharpen our plotting skills, perform some numerical integration, and function fitting. Let's the fun begin!\n","\n","## Experiment 1: Sjöstrand-method\n","\n","Nils Göran Sjöstrand was one of the pioneers of reactor physics. He proposed an elegant method to measure the reactivity in subcritical reactors. His article from 1956, describing the area ratio method, is one of the most cited Swedish publications in reactor physics, and still today there is an interest in applying his work. The reason is the recent development of Accelerator Driven Systems envisoned to be able to reduce the lifetime of nuclear waste by transmuting it. Such systems are subcritical reactors driven by a strong neutron source. Thus being able to measure the subcritical reactivity is just as important for safety as it was nearly 70 years ago. (Further reading on Nils Göran Sjöstrand: https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/snec/news/Pages/Nils-G%C3%B6ran-Sj%C3%B6strand-1925---2014.aspx)\n","\n","\n","The area method allows the determination of the reactivity in a subcritical nuclear reactor when a pulsed neutron source experiment is performed. Initially the reactor is subcritical with a constant source, hence operating in steady state. A pulsed neutron source is added which allows for shooting neutrons into the reactor under a short period of time periodically, for example 1-2 $\\mu s$ long pulses in each 12 ms. The technique is based on the analysis of the time response of detectors located in the reactor after the pulses. See the figures at https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/snec/news/Pages/Nils-G%C3%B6ran-Sj%C3%B6strand-1925---2014.aspx or Fig. 5.1 at https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:315354/FULLTEXT01.pdf. The reason why the pulsing is required because one wants to have a equilibrium emission of delayed neutrons. For one single pulse the background would be noisy.\n","\n","The time response has some distinct features. First the signal rises (neutrons need time to reach the detector) then there is an exponential decay of counts due to the prompt neutrons and finally one can observe an approximately constant tail due to the delayed neutrons. If one calculated the area under the prompt peak ($A_p$) and under the constant background ($A_d$), one can get a simple expression for the reactivity measured in \\\\$:\n","\n","$$\\frac{A_p}{A_d}=-\\frac{\\rho}{\\beta}$$\n","\n","where $\\beta$ is the total delayed neutron fraction. There is also an other interesting quantity one can obtain from such a measurement. As described in Sec 5.2 of https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:315354/FULLTEXT01.pdf (page 42-43), by fitting an exponential to the downfalling side of the time response one can obtain $\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\beta}$.\n","\n","Let's assume that we have performed a measurement in a subcritical reactor. The period of the neutron pulses is T=10 ms, and the detector records the counts in every dt = 100 $\\mu s$.

These neutrons can be detected, but it is not possible to determine the origin of the neutrons by only counting them. However, by studying the timing of the detected neutrons, more information about the origin of the neutrons can be determined. One frequently used method is based on the so-called Rossi-alpha distribution.\n","\n","The basic idea behind the Rossi-alpha distribution is to look at every detected neutron, and for each such neutorn look at when subsequent neutrons are detected. For uncorrelated neutrons, such as neutrons originating in different, independant spontaneous fission events, the time difference between the neutrons are random. However, if multiple neutrons originate from the same fission event, they will be correlated in time. Also, some of these neutrons could induce further fission, and the neutrons from the subsequent fission event are then time-correlated to any neutrons from the first event. \n","\n","To investigate Rossi-alpha distributions in this datalab, we first need to create a Monte-Carlo simulation of the detected neutrons. For simplicity, we will ignore ($\\alpha$,n) reactions, and assume that any produced neutron can either induce a new fission, be detected, or be lost to other processes. The idea is to first sample random times when spontaneous fission occur. Next, the number of emitted neutrons are sampled. For each neutron, we sample if it causes another fission (repeating the process), or if not, we sample if it is detected or not.\n","\n","To sample the random times when sponteneous fissions occur, two methods can be used. The first is to note that within a certain time interval, the detection times are uniformly distributed in time. So if an average of $n$ neutrons are expected in a certain time, we can sample $n$ values from a uniform distribution and sort them, to obtain the detected neutron timings. The second is to note that for uncorrelated events, the time between two subsequent events is exponentially distributed. We will implement the second method.\n","\n","We will assume that the time between the fission event and the detection of a neutron is also exponentially distributed. \n","\n","Each spontaneous fission neutron will induce further fissions with a probability $p$. We will model a system containing primarily U-235 as the fisslie isotope, so that the average number of neutrons per fission is about 2.43. Hence, we have approximately that $k = 2.43*p$, for the corresponding multiplication. The time between the initial fission and the induced fission is a bit more complicated to model, so for simplicity we will assume that this one is also exponentially distributed, with a different average time between events as compared to the spontanous fissions. \n","\n","Finally, the Monte-Carlo sampler will also include a detection efficiency, that samples if a neutron was detected or not.
