    "During the first openMC datalab we have covered the basics, and covered how to write a basic input, how to run it and how to post-process the results. Today we go one step further and will explore the real power of the python API. Namely, that we can automatize calculations simply by defining a function which creates the input for us. Then we can write loops and automatically update our model. For this we will use the `Model()` class of openMC. This basically means that instead of exporting all the details of the run into xml, openMC will take care of this, when we call the `.run()` method of the class.\n",

For a finite core, of course usually we would like to know the critical boron content, but now we have reflective boundaries, so for the demonstration we aim for higher than 1.0 multiplication factor.\n",

    "- we have decreased the number of particles per batch: although we will have a worse accuracy, but we will need to run this input several times, so it is not sustainable to use the datalab for waiting the calculations to finish\n",
    "- we have not included a numeric ID for the `Material()` instances. In this case openMC will increment the ID number. Since in these examples we do not use the IDs for anything, we can live without controlling it. (If we kept the ID, openMC would send a warning all the time that the ID was already in used. It is a warning, so not an error, but still annoying).\n",

Also, it is worth mentioning that void levels investigated here are never reached in normal operations for a PWR, but are however the nominal levels for a BWR. Nevertheless, the goal of the exercise is not to investigate exact reactor operation scenarios, rather to provide a physicist insight for understanding how significantly lowering the density of the moderator affects the multiplication factor.\n",
