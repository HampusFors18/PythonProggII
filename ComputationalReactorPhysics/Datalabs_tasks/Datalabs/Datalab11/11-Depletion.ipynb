    "During this datalab we will investigate how the fuel changes during the reactor operation. For this we will use openmc's `deplete` module. OpenMC solves the transport problem with a Monte Carlo approach to obtain reaction rates, and then the Batemen-equations are solved with these reaction rates. Nevertheless, the coupling between the depletion and the transport calculation is not a trivial task, there are various coupling schemes to do so. Within this datalab we do not look into depth of various coupling techniques, and we will just use the most default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve an accurate depletion study one needs to have as many time steps when the depletion equations are solved as possible, due to this, burnup calculations are time consuming, espescially when based on Monte Carlo transport solvers. During this datalab we will focus on the phenomena and on qualitative results, therefore we will not care about accuracy. That said we will use only few particles per batch, and very long depletion steps. We will also neglect downtime periods (when the reactor is not operating).\n",

    "1. We will use our good old PWR pincell model to investigate how the neutron spectrum, the k-eigenvalue and the nuclide concentrations change over time\n",
